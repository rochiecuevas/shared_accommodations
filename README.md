### Data cleaning
#### Hotel data
The [dataset](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations/blob/master/Hotel%20Data/hotel_indicators.csv) contains average daily rates, occupancy rates, and revenue per available room.

#### Peer-to-peer home rental data
The [dataset](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations/tree/master/Airbnb%20Listings%20Data%20) is originally found in 28 csv files. The data is cleaned and the relevant metrics are merged into one csv file using the [`Airbnb_listings.ipynb`](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations/blob/master/Airbnb%20Listings%20Data%20/Airbnb_listings.ipynb) jupyter notebook. A detailed description can be found [here](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations/blob/master/Airbnb%20Listings%20Data%20/README.md).
