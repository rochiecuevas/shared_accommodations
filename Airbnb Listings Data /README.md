# Cleaning the Airbnb Listings Dataset (2015â€“2017)
This dataset was downloaded from [published Airbnb rates](http://insideairbnb.com/san-francisco/?neighbourhood=&filterEntireHomes=false&filterHighlyAvailable=false&filterRecentReviews=false&filterMultiListings=false) within San Francisco, from 2015 to 2017. The data in it was gathered by Murray Cox's Inside Airbnb, a non-commercial and independent set of tools that collects publicly available data from Airbnb.
